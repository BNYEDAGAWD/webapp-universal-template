### 3. Key Viewability Challenges and Opportunities

**Challenges:**
- Venti Video (out-stream enabled display video) shows lower traditional viewability metrics (59.5% average)
- Significant variation in viewability across publishers (from 55% to 91%)
- Complex measurement requirements for innovative formats
- Distinguishing performance between Venti Animated and Venti Video units

**Opportunities:**
- Runway Display's exceptional 91.7% viewability demonstrates format optimization potential
- Venti Animated's strong performance (73.2% viewability, 18.3s engagement) shows animated format success
- Strong engagement times across all formats indicate user interest
- Premium publishers (People.com, Merriam-Webster) showing excellent performance with Venti Animated

### 4. Format Comparison Analysis

**Venti Video (Out-Stream Display Video) Viewability Breakdown:**
- 1-5 seconds viewable: 19.9%
- 5-15 seconds viewable: 13.0%
- >15 seconds viewable: 26.4%
- 100% Display Viewable: 26.0%

**Venti Animated Viewability Breakdown:**
- 1-5 seconds viewable: 15.2%
- 5-15 seconds viewable: 18.7%
- >15 seconds viewable: 39.3%
- 100% Display Viewable: 31.8%

This distribution shows that Venti Animated performs significantly better than Venti Video, with higher completion rates and longer view times. Venti Video's lower initial viewability is offset by strong engagement for users who do interact, demonstrating the viewability paradox where out-stream video creates selective but highly engaged audiences.

- people.com: 90.8%
- sallysbakingaddiction.com: 87.7%

- Recipe sites (therecipecritic.com, gimmesomeoven.com): 42-45% viewability, 17-18s view time

### 6. The Kargo Viewability Paradox

The data strongly supports Kargo's viewability paradox narrative, particularly with the distinction between Venti formats:

**Evidence of the Paradox:**
1. **Venti Video (Out-Stream Display Video)** shows lower traditional viewability (59.5%) but:
   - Achieves 14.7s average view time
   - 26.4% of viewers watch for >15 seconds
   - Demonstrates selective engagement where lower viewability correlates with higher user intent

2. **Venti Animated** achieves the best of both worlds:
   - Strong traditional viewability (73.2%)
   - Excellent engagement (18.3s average view time)
   - 39.3% of viewers watch for >15 seconds
   - Proves that innovative formats can achieve both high viewability and engagement

3. **High-Impact Sites** demonstrate the paradox:
   - Recipe/lifestyle sites show 42-45% viewability but 17-18s engagement with Venti Video
   - Gaming sites (ign.com) show 52% viewability but 22s+ engagement with Venti Video
   - Premium content sites achieve 85%+ viewability with Venti Animated
   - Extended view times indicate deep user engagement across both format types

4. **Format Innovation Impact:**
   - Runway Display's 91.7% viewability with 20.9s view time shows format optimization success
   - Venti Animated bridges the gap between viewability and engagement
   - Venti Video's out-stream nature creates selective but highly engaged audiences
   - The variance between formats suggests different user interaction patterns optimized for different content environments

### Strategic Insights

1. **Value Beyond Traditional Metrics:**
   - Extended engagement times on lower-viewability sites suggest quality over quantity
   - Kargo's innovative formats create different engagement patterns than standard display

2. **Format Selection Strategy:**
   - Use Runway Display for maximum viewability on premium sites
   - Deploy Venti Animated for balanced high viewability and engagement on premium content sites
   - Deploy Venti Video (out-stream) for deep engagement on lifestyle/entertainment sites where user intent is high
   - Enhanced Pre-Roll provides balanced performance across all metrics

3. **Publisher Optimization:**
   - Premium news sites: Optimal for Venti Animated and Runway Display (85%+ viewability)
   - Lifestyle/recipe sites: Perfect for Venti Video out-stream (deep engagement despite lower viewability)
   - Gaming/entertainment sites: Venti Video excels with extended interaction times
   - Business/financial sites: Venti Animated performs exceptionally well

4. **The Innovation Advantage:**
   - Kargo's dual Venti approach optimizes for different user contexts
   - Venti Animated proves innovative formats can achieve both high viewability and engagement
   - Venti Video demonstrates that out-stream video creates quality engagement despite lower initial viewability
   - Success should be measured by engagement depth and format-appropriate metrics, not just traditional viewability

### Conclusion

The DoubleVerify data validates Kargo's position that innovative ad formats deliver value beyond traditional viewability metrics. The distinction between Venti Animated and Venti Video reveals two different optimization strategies:

- **Venti Animated** proves that innovative formats can achieve both high traditional viewability (73.2%) and strong engagement (18.3s), making it ideal for premium content environments
- **Venti Video** (out-stream enabled display video) demonstrates the "viewability paradox" where lower initial viewability (59.5%) correlates with selective, high-intent user engagement (14.7s), making it perfect for lifestyle and entertainment contexts

This dual approach allows Kargo to optimize for different publisher environments and user contexts, delivering superior value through both traditional metrics and quality engagement. The data confirms that innovative ad formats can successfully capture user attention in ways that transcend simple viewability measurements, with each format serving its optimal use case.
